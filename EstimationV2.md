# Project Estimation - FUTURE

Date: 2024-05-03

Version: 2

# Estimation approach

Consider the EZElectronics project in FUTURE version (as proposed by your team in requirements V2), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course, and from scratch (not from V1)

# Estimate by size

We believe in `v2` we'll be able to improve the project without increasing the code base too much, additional time and review processes lead to effective refactoring and smaller average class footprint.

We estimate in total $\displaystyle\frac{\sum E_i}{N * H * W} \approx 3.3$ calendar weeks to complete the project, where $E_i$ is the estimated effort for each component, $N$ is the number of people working on the project, $H$ is the number of working hours per day, and $W$ is the number of working days per week.

## Estimate by activity decomposition

All of our activities are based on the `IEEE 12207` standard.

Compared to `v1`, we have added some activities that we consider necessary to expand the product how we envisioned.

With a total estimated effort of $\sum{\sum_{i=a}^g i} = 724$ person hours, we can calculate that it will take $\approx 4.5$ calendar weeks to complete the project, given a team of 4 people working 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.
